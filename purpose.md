### Noisy sine wave on a linear trend

#### Purpose

Demonstrate a synthetic signal consisting of _data + random noise + a linear trend_. 
Also show effect of smoothing the noisy signal. 
Signal is sine wave with adjustable samples/cycle and smoothing is an adjustable N-pt moving avg. (i.e. a N-pt boxcar convolution). 
Sine wave is plotted as points while smoothed is plotted as lines.
