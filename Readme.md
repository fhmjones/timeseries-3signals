# Signals and noise demonstration

Explore how signals, noise and slow trends affect abilities to learn about a simple artificial time series.

## Example questions that could be considered to generate discussion

These types of questions could drive teaching discussions or learning assignments. Questions may not be well-posed. Also, most are judgement calls - which is part of the point!
1. How much noise does it take to obscure the fact there is a nice sine-wave signal?
2. If there are only 2 or 3 cycles of signal, can you tell there is a trend? What are the implications for the "length" of your data set or series of measurements?
3. Does noise obscure the fact that there is a superimposed linear trend?
4. What does "more" smoothing do to the signal? Is there a compromise between not enough smoothing and too much?
